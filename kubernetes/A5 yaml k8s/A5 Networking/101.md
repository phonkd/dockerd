## Ip adresses
- Each node gets a private ip adress (e.g 192.168.1.10)
- Each pod gets an internal ip adress (e.g 10.244.0.2)
- Pods are in the same internal network

>[!warning] Accessing pods via ip
Is a bad idea since their IP might change on recreation.

## Networking on multiple nodes (in a cluster)
**Example:**
- Node 1:
	- internal network 10.244.0.0
	- private ip adress 192.168.1.2
	- Pod ip 10.244.0.2
- Node 2
	- Internal network 10.244.0.0
	- Priave ip adress 192.168.1.3
	- Pod ip 10.244.0.2

## Kubernetes network requirements
>[!warning]
>This situation will cause ip conflicts which could possibly break pods.
>By default, kubernetes doesnt configure networks to prevent such issues.
>**Such issues can only be prevented by fulfilling kubernetes network requirements:**
>- All containers/PODs can communicate to one another without NAT
>- All nodes can communicate with all containers and vice versa without NAT
> **Prebuild solutions meeting those requirements:**
